This is a demo post to show you how to write blog posts with markdown.  I strongly encourage you to [take 5 minutes to learn how to write in markdown](https://markdowntutorial.com/) - it'll teach you how to transform regular text into bold/italics/tables/etc.<br/>I also encourage you to look at the [code that created this post](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/daattali/beautiful-jekyll/master/_posts/2020-02-28-sample-markdown.md) to learn some more advanced tips about using markdown in Beautiful Jekyll.

**Here is some bold text**
<div class="accordion" id="accordionExample">
  <div class="accordion-item">
    <h2 class="accordion-header">
      <button class="accordion-button" type="button" data-bs-toggle="collapse" data-bs-target="#collapseOne" aria-expanded="true" aria-controls="collapseOne">
        Accordion Item #1
      </button>
    </h2>
    <div id="collapseOne" class="accordion-collapse collapse show" data-bs-parent="#accordionExample">
      <div class="accordion-body">
        <strong>This is the first item's accordion body.</strong> It is shown by default, until the collapse plugin adds the appropriate classes that we use to style each element. These classes control the overall appearance, as well as the showing and hiding via CSS transitions. You can modify any of this with custom CSS or overriding our default variables. It's also worth noting that just about any HTML can go within the <code>.accordion-body</code>, though the transition does limit overflow.
      </div>

  <div class="accordion-item">
    <h2 class="accordion-header">

    <div id="collapseTwo" class="accordion-collapse collapse" data-bs-parent="#accordionExample">

## Here is a secondary heading

[This is a link to a different site](https://deanattali.com/) and [this is a link to a section inside this page](#local-urls).

Here's a table:

| Number | Next number | Previous number |
| :------ |:--- | :--- |
| Five | Six | Four |
| Ten | Eleven | Nine |
| Seven | Eight | Six |
| Two | Three | One |

How about a yummy crepe?

![Crepe](https://beautifuljekyll.com/assets/img/crepe.jpg)

It can also be centered!

![Crepe](https://beautifuljekyll.com/assets/img/crepe.jpg){: .mx-auto.d-block :}

Here's a code chunk:

~~~
var foo = function(x) {
  return(x + 5);
}
foo(3)
~~~

And here is the same code with syntax highlighting:

```javascript
var foo = function(x) {
  return(x + 5);
}
foo(3)
```

And here is the same code yet again but with line numbers:

{% highlight javascript linenos %}
var foo = function(x) {
  return(x + 5);
}
foo(3)
{% endhighlight %}

## Boxes
You can add notification, warning and error boxes like this:

### Notification

{: .box-note}
**Note:** This is a notification box.

### Warning

{: .box-warning}
**Warning:** This is a warning box.

### Error

{: .box-error}
**Error:** This is an error box.

## Local URLs in project sites {#local-urls}

When hosting a *project site* on GitHub Pages (for example, `https://USERNAME.github.io/MyProject`), URLs that begin with `/` and refer to local files may not work correctly due to how the root URL (`/`) is interpreted by GitHub Pages. You can read more about it [in the FAQ](https://beautifuljekyll.com/faq/#links-in-project-page). To demonstrate the issue, the following local image will be broken **if your site is a project site:**

![Crepe](/assets/img/crepe.jpg)

If the above image is broken, then you'll need to follow the instructions [in the FAQ](https://beautifuljekyll.com/faq/#links-in-project-page). Here is proof that it can be fixed:

![Crepe]({{ '/assets/img/crepe.jpg' | relative_url }})
